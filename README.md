# TelegramBot-E-Shop
I managed to attach the Django Framework to my Telegram Bot and set a webhook. I've been developing it from 10th of November 2021 and I want to have a basic working prototype.

I'd already had an understanding of working with third-party API, request/response cycle. But with this project I got to know how to work with Telegram Api using Django.

Besides, I've used a FONDY (payment system) API to make payment splits on religionpeace.live website.
